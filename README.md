# CheckFour--PersonalProject
one of my personal projects in my journey to mastering python and pygame
this is actually the first object oriented style python project for me and the first time i used classes in python
the project consists of two main applications:
  a command line application checkFour game that plays the same rules as the standard check four game
  a graphical interface 
the command line application and calsses were written by me
the graphical pygame interface was taken from an online course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc&t=9576s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org time stamp: 2:00:00 - 2:24:00) with changes to match the command line application and object oriented style
