# CheckFour--PersonalProject
one of my personal projects in my journey to mastering python and pygame<br>
this is actually the first object oriented style python project for me and the first time i used classes in python<br>
the project consists of two main applications:<br>
  a command line application checkFour game that plays the same rules as the standard check four game<br>
  a graphical interface <br>
the command line application and calsses were written by me<br>
the graphical pygame interface was taken from an online course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc&t=9576s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org time stamp: 2:00:00 - 2:24:00) with<br> changes to match the command line application and object oriented style
